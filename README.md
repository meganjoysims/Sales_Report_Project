# Sales_Report_Project

Why are we doing this - 
In order to round up our learning of c#/sql from academy and show off what
we're now able to achieve 

How I expected the challenge to go - 
I expected to be fairly comfortable with the challenge based on what we had learned during 
our time in academy but also anticipated there would be a couple of challenges along the 
way.

What went well - 
I felt my understanding was solidified whilst completing the task and I was really pleased 
with what I had manage to retain from academy and how I was able to implement that into 
something I had made.
I was pleased I was able to loop the menus back into one another so that the application 
stays open for further interaction instead of closing once each menu section had been completed

What didn't go as planned -
I wouldn't necessarily say it didn't go as planned, but I didn't use the auto-increment 
feature of SQL when creating my table, I incremented the SaleID through my add data 
function. It would have been a lot easier to use the auto incremement feature but because 
the logic I used worked and took time to implement, I kept it in there.

Possible Improvements for future -
The look of the project is very basic so given more time it would have been good to make the 
menus a little nicer to look at and interact with. This is limited working on a c# project 
in the console but there are additions I could have made to improve the project
